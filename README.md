Power Supply Cover - This is a cover for the rear of a 12v 30 amp power supply. I wanted to cover the dangerous bits on the back. The parts above the contacts will be louvered for air flow. There is an access on each side for the power to come in and exit from the contacts. I have also added a power switch it. I need to add LEDs for status as well. http://www.amazon.com/Universal-Regulated-Switching-Computer-Project/dp/B00D7CWSCG/ref=sr_1_1?s=electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1441200867&sr=1-1&keywords=12v+30+amp+power+supply

connector gear - Toy part

shim for Kevo - We tried to install the Kwikset Kevo lock on our doors but the windows frame was in the way. I looked into trimming back the frame but one of the carpenters suggested a shim. I created the shim to fit under the metal plate used to mount the inside of the deadbolt. This allowed the plate to sit flat on the shim and provided room for the lock housing to slide on smoothly.
