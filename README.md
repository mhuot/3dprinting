Power Supply Cover - This is a cover for the rear of a 12v 30 amp power supply. I wanted to cover the dangerous bits on the back. The parts above the contacts will be louvered for air flow. There is an access on each side for the power to come in and exit from the contacts. I have also added a power switch it. I need to add LEDs for status as well. http://www.amazon.com/Universal-Regulated-Switching-Computer-Project/dp/B00D7CWSCG/ref=sr_1_1?s=electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1441200867&sr=1-1&keywords=12v+30+amp+power+supply
